# Artemis Project

![Preview](Artemis/images/Preview.png)

This page is a personal design practice. It includes four main sections focused on layout, animations, and visual atmosphere.

## Inspiration

I drew inspiration from editorial styles and modern UI components found across various websites. The goal was to explore visual modularity and experiment with animated entrances using real-world design references.

## Technologies

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with animations and transformations)  
- JavaScript (for interactions)

# CarRental Project

![Preview](CarRental/images/Preview.png)

This page is a design exercise focused on refining subtle animations, layout composition, and grid-based structuring.  The project also served to experiment with component layering and responsive behavior.

## Inspiration

The design is a reinterpretation of an existing template from another website. While the structure is not original, the goal was to study its modularity and replicate its visual logic to better understand editorial flow and UI dynamics.

## Technologies

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with transitions, transforms, and grid layout)  
- JavaScript (for interactions and dynamic content)

## Purpose

To practice visual design and modular structure through hands-on experimentation.
